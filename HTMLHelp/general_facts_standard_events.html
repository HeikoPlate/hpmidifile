This topic is concerned with functions working upon the MIDI-events Note, Aftertouch,
Controller, RPN, NRPN, Program Change, Channel Pressure and Pitch Wheel.
<BR>
<BR>
All these events are associated with MIDI-channels.
<BR>
<BR>
The three events Note, RPN and NRPN listed above are compound MIDI-events. Each of these are realized
by two or more basic MIDI-events, which have to follow one after another in a defined order.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Note</B>
<BR>
Note-events consist of the basic events "Note On", later followed by "Note Off". The distance
of time between both events is the length of the note.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>RPN and NRPN</B>
<BR>
These events often are called "Extended Controller-events", because these are contructed by
three or four Controller-events which follow directly one after another.
<BR>
The first two basic events "RPN-MSB" and "RPN-LSB" or "NRPN-MSB" and "NRPN-LSB" define the type of RPN / NRPN.
After this we have the specification of event-data by the two events "Data-MSB" and "Data-LSB" or one of
the events "Data-Increment", "Data-Decrement".
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Programming Notes, RPN or NRPN with HP MIDIFILE, we are not confrontated with the basic events. The
functions only work with compound events; the basic events of these are hidden to the programmer.
It is not possible to read, insert, change and delete these. This is allowed only implicite with
the compound event itself. HP MIDIFILE takes care that each compound event gets its correct basic
events needed. The only contact with basic events happens with the function HP_ReadEvent which walks
sequentially through the internal eventlist.
