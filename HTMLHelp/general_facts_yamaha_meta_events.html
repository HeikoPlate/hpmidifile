The Meta events of this topic are manufacturer depended ones. The events belong to YAMAHA's
formats XG (Extended General MIDI) and XF (Extended Standard MIDI-file format SMF). The events
are used in XG/XF-MIDI-files, which are offered by YAMAHA and also created by users with their
modern YAMAHA keyboards, for example the Tyros.
<BR>
<BR>
The functions and structures of these events can be found in the XG- and XF-specifications. Some
are explained in the keyboard's manuals only and others are not yet documented for public use.
<BR>
<BR>
In HP MIDIFILE we offer functions to read and insert most events, which are known at
this time. To change an event, apply the sequence "HP_DeleteEvent", "HP_Insert...".
There is only one event-type, the Chord event, which is logical interpreted by
HP MIDIFILE. The functions for the other events do not work on a logical interpretation
but only with the raw event-data. To apply the functions the user must have knowledge of the
structures.
<BR>
<BR>
The type "Other YAMAHA Meta" is implemented to allow programming arbitrary YAMAHA Meta events,
which are not yet known.
